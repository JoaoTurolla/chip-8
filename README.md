# chip-8
Tried emulating a chip-8 in C++ code to better understand the lower levels of computers.

This is a challenge I've given myself;

For the next 6 weeks (from 2025-12-10 to 2026-01-21) I'll be searching for references and documentations about how a chip-8 works, to then translate it into code, I aim 
to not depend on Youtube videos that explain how it works, nor any "AI" that could help.

I have extended the time limit for 3 main reasons:
  - Holidays kept me out of the pc more than I wanted
  - Changed OS now I am using an Arch-based Linux distro
  - I can't commit anymore, I do not understand why git is not allowing me to do it, so I need extra time to figure this out
