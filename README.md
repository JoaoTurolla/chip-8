# chip-8
Tried emulating a chip-8 in C++ code to better understand the lower levels of computers.

This is a challenge I've given myself;

For the next 3 weeks I'll be searching for references and documentations about how a chip-8 works, to then translate it into code, I aim 
to not depend on Youtube videos that explain how it works, nor any "AI" that could help.
