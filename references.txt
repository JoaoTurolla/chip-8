Here are the links to the websites I visited. As you will see I chose to format dates as YYYY-MM-DD

-Austin Morlan guide to emulating a chip-8 in C++:

https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/?ref=codebldr last access: 2025-12-11

Notes: I'll use this one mainly to check the graphics and file handling code as I know nothing about graphics and just a little of file handling


-Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference v1.0:

http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#2.0 last access: 2025-12-11

Notes: This technical reference will be my main source of info for the challenge, may change it as I see fit while
looking for more documention on Chip-8, if I do change it there will be updates and additions to this file, but never
will I remove any source from here.
